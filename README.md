# Comedy-Show-Finder
A comedy app that lets users find comedy shows nearby
General Idea:::
a comedy show finder where you can find an event by searching a location. Once you have your area narrowed in, you can click on an  upcoming performer to  get more curated comedian information!

Target Audience:::
Comedy Enthusiasts

Primary Problem:::
Searching for and hearing about shows can be difficult when living in a busy city! Our app aims to provide users with general comedian information such as, Rating (family friendly or not), Topics (political humor, vulgarity) and Popularity. We are also aiming to provide youtube clips and IMDB pages for some of the post popular comedians!

Primary Goal:::
Make it easier for users to access comedy shows in their area.


Identify and prioritize user stories:::
As a Joe Roggan fan, I want to find suitable shows near me to learn more about how life works so that I can understand things better
